<br>

## Personal Intro ##
I took part as an individual and all code has been written and tested by myself. My approach can be viewed in the notebooks folder.<br>
This is my first participation in a Kaggle competition, my submission got ranked in **place 274/3632** (top 8%) 
with a **score of 0.89762**. <br>

The following is the official Kaggle description, as found here: <br>

## Overview
**Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series!** Happy New Year! This is the 1st episode of Season 4. We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, 
providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

**Your Goal:** 
For this Episode of the Series, your task is to predict whether a customer continues with their account or closes it (e.g., churns).

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission File
For each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable Exited. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
```bash
id,Exited
165034,0.9
165035,0.1
165036,0.5
etc.
```
## Timeline
- Start Date - January 2, 2024
- Entry Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline
- Team Merger Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline
- Final Submission Deadline - January 31, 2024 <br>

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline 
if they deem it necessary.

## About the Tabular Playground Series
The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and 
sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have 
longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from 
real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

#### Synthetically-Generated Datasets
Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels 
are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic 
data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets 
that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!
